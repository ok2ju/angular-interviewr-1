AngularJS App of INTERVIEWR

## Prerequisites 

Interviewr-ui is an [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) single page web application which runs on a [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) server using [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/).

## Installation

Clone repo:

    git clone https://github.com/futturum/angular-interviewr.git

Then install npm dependencies by running following command:

    npm install

## Development

To start develop run following command in your terminal:

    cd angular-interviewr && npm start
    
Visit your app at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

## Note

ExpressJS server running at `port:8000`
But BrowserSync proxying it at `port:4000`. NodeJS API allow to establish connection to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). When development will be done, change CORS-enable part at Back-End API to allow establish connection on `port:8000` (IMPORTANT).

## Code quality standards

###### [Feature File Names]

Use consistent names for all components following a pattern `feature.type.js`

```javascript

    // controllers
    profile.controller.js

    // services/factories
    logger.service.js

    // constants
    constants.js

    // module definition
    profile.module.js

    // routes
    profile.routes.js

    // configuration
    profile.config.js

    // directives
    avenger-profile.directive.js
```

###### [Controller and Service Names]

Use UpperCamelCase for controllers and services

```javascript

    // profile.controller.js
    angular
        .module
        .controller('ProfileController', ProfileController);

    function ProfileController() { }
```

```javascript

    // profile.service.js
    angular
        .module
        .factory('profileService', profileService);

    function profileService() { }
```
